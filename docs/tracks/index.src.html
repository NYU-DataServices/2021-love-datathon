            <h2>Stepping Through History<br/><a href="https://persistent.library.nyu.edu/arch/148cd8d4">ProQuest Historical Newspapers</a></h2>
            <p><strong>About the data</strong>: ProQuest Historical Newspapers collection contains machine-readable full text and accompanying metadata for newspapers at the individual article level for 26 historical newspapers. There are 55 million digitized pages, most covering the 1800s and 1900s. One feature of newspapers that has a long history are advertisements, and in fact the ProQuest company has labeled each advertisement in its collection so that we are able to analyse them separately.</p>
            <p><strong>Challenge Goals</strong>: What if we were to hold a century’s worth of newspaper advertisements and their features in one dataset? What could we learn about the companies who have advertised and the products they have presented? What would we need to do to obtain that information from unmarked text produced from OCR software? The goal set by this challenge will be to extract elements from these historical newspapers, fix OCR errors in the files at scale, and use NLP to identify different elements of advertisements across the centuries.</p>

            <h2>Helping the NYU Community<br/><a href="https://guides.nyu.edu/l2political">L2 Political Extracts</a></h2>
            <p><strong>About the data</strong>: NYU Libraries licensed access to L2 Political’s voter file and historical voter file data, a continuously updated database of every registered voter in the United States which includes basic socio-demographic indicators (some of which are modeled), consumer preferences, political party affiliation, voting history, and more. The data is fairly well-structured. You can learn more at the <a href="https://guides.nyu.edu/l2political">research guide</a>.</p>
            <p><strong>Challenge Goals</strong>: The challenge has two primary goals: 1) generate "surrogates" of this data that are created to increase anonymity of voters in the file (so others at NYU can use it more freely), and 2) you will further expand the ability of users to operate with these files responsibly. That includes building out better scripts for users and making the data more attainable.</p>

            <h2>Mapping Climatological Futures<br/><a href="https://doi.org/10.1029/2008GL035143">India Meteorological Data</a></h2>
            <p><strong>About the data</strong>: NYU Libraries has licensed some grid point data that represents amounts of rainfall, temperature ranges, and humidity measures over the 20th century in India at the district level. According to a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-solutions/2020/06/12/india-emissions-climate/?arc404=true">June 2020 article in the Washington Post</a>, India plays a pivotal role in the potential for survival in our current climacteric.  The India Meteorological Department Climate Centre data is a rich dataset with many possibilities.</p>
            <p><strong>Challenge Goals</strong>: This is the "sandbox" data challenge -- we don't have a specific  but teams can choose to tackle several angles. Some ideas from us include: developing a well-documented notebook with code and examples that make the confusing directory structure easier for non-experts to use; developing more GIS-friendly products, such as rasters, shapefiles that are aggregated to the district level, etc. that would have free-standing research value.</p>
