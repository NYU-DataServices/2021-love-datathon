Details
When does the event start?
The event starts on the 5th of Feb, Friday, at 12pm ET. You can attend the kickoff live here [link]. 
When does the event end?
The final datathon submissions will be links to your projects (either GitHub or otherwise) submitted by 1:30pm ET on Friday, 12th February. 
Who can participate?/Where can I sign up?
This event is only open to NYU Undergraduate, Graduate, and Post-Graduate students. To officially sign up, go on the spreadsheet here [link] and either start your own team or join an open one!
When do I get the data?
The data is large for all three tracks. We will pre-load it onto NYU’s High Performance Computing unit and give each participant access to it (and some computational resources) right after Kickoff. 
I don't know how to use some of these technologies. Can I still participate?
Sure! This is why we encourage you to participate with teams with different backgrounds. Besides, we have workshops [link] for you. 
What is the Zoom link?/Where is the event being held?
All the appropriate links can be found here [link’]. This event is 100% virtual. 
Who is hosting the event?
The Data Science Club is hosting the datathon in collaboration with NYU Libraries.  
Are there technologies that are restricted?
No, there are no restrictions to the types of technology that can be used, so get creative!
Can I work by myself?
Sorry, but due to the limited number of judges we cannot have any individuals working by themselves.
What are the tracks?
We have three tracks: Stepping through History, Helping the NYU Community, and Making the Most of Maps. For more information, click the link here [link].
How do I know what track to choose?
Choose the one that interests you and your team the most! 😃👍
Can I change tracks?
Sorry, you cannot change tracks. You have a 24 hour-period to finalize your track – from Friday 4pm to Saturday 4pm ET.
What is a sandbox challenge?
Good question! A sandbox challenge in programming is a testing environment for untested code and experimentation. The Sandbox approach helps facilitate a safe environment to play with unexplored data. 
Why can’t I do all the tracks?
All the tracks run parallelly so you wouldn’t be able to do all. We love the ambition, but we want everyone to have a fair shot at winning so please just submit one project for one track.
What are the important deadlines?
Saturday 4pm ET - Finalize teams and Track
Sunday 4pm ET- Submit 5-minute “idea” video.
Friday (12th Feb) 1:30pm ET - Final Submissions Due
What if I think I’m not good enough to win? 
You are, it’s all about the experience ! Also-  we have workshops for you! 😃👍
I am not in the same timezone as New York - how do things work for me?
You can coordinate with your team and delegate tasks so work can be done at different times depending on what you determine is best. Also - all the workshops and sessions will be recorded and available to you here [link]. 
Do I need to stay up late?
No. You can if you want, but getting rest is also important! 😃
How do I know if I'm registered?
If your name appears somewhere on this [link] Google Spreadsheet, then you’re all set! 


Teams

How do I form a team?/How many people can I have on my team?
To form teams just reach out on the #looking-for-teammates chat on slack, message your friends, or join an open team on the spreadsheet! Teams must be 2-5 people with no more than 2 graduate students per team.
Where can I collaborate with my team?
You can create groups using Slack or connect with them via social media! If you’re having trouble, let us know during our support hours and we can help.
I messaged in the Slack but I still don’t have a team, what do I do?
Just try to reach out to the teams that are “green”/open on the spreadsheet. If there are no open teams, make your own team and reach out to some people or wait for someone to reach out to you. You’re not the only one in this situation. 
When do I get my teams?
The organizers do not assign you teams - you can find new people/register as a team here [link]. 


Workshops
Are there workshops or educational opportunities? And if so, what are the workshops?
We have many workshops!
Intro to unix/linux shell 
Data cleaning and data management using python 
Getting started with python pandas 
Getting started with with GIS using Q-GIS
Data cleaning with Q-GIS
Collaborating with Git and GitHub
Getting started with Jupyter + JupyterHub 
Understanding Regular Expressions (Regex)
What if the workshops clash with my classes?
They will be recorded and posted here[links], so you can access them at any time.
Do I have to attend the workshops?
No. You can choose to attend them if you think it would be helpful, but it is not mandatory. 

Help/Support
What’s the schedule for tech support?
You can find the information here [link]!
My code is not working and I need help. Where can I go to troubleshoot?
You can visit #ask-a-librarian [link] with your tech questions and someone will get back to you during the support hours. 
I don't understand what a specific track is asking me to do. Who do I contact for help?
You should try to have all your track -specific questions answered before you make a decision on Saturday the 6th at 4pm ET. You can contact the library if you have any questions at #ask-a-librarian.


Submission
What does the final submission need to contain?
This will be different for each track and more details will be sent to you closer to the submission deadline. Mostly the format will be a github/website/gdrive link. 
How is the datathon being judged? When will winners be announced?


Are there limitations to how we approach the track?
No! In fact, there are extra points for creativity. The 5 minute “idea” video you submit on Sunday the 7th at 4pm carries 30% of your score and it is scored for creativity. 
Can I submit the project earlier? 
Yes, you can submit the project whenever you finish! We will make the submission link available soon. 
Prizes 
What are the prizes and awards? Are there separate prizes for each track? 
We have two kinds of awards: spirit and track-based. There are four different awards per track: best overall, clearest visualization, most reusable, and creativest solution. Prizes include 1 on 1 custom workshops, internship opportunities, exclusive meetings with esteemed faculty, cash, 3-D printed trophies, and more!
What is the team spirit award? What are the Team spirit Events?
The team spirit award includes sending short videos or pictures from the whole team about your idea (there will be rubric provided) and the DSC will do the first evaluation which takes 30% of the score overall. The team spirit challenges will also include smaller things like sending pictures of you hydrating yourself! These will be announced soon.
