<p>You can compete in teams of between 2 - 5 current NYU students. Teams can consist of any number of undergraduate students and maximum 2 graduate students. We highly encourage that at least one team member comes from a field <em>outside</em> data science or computer science. Look for a team and register your team here (must be logged into NYU to view and edit): <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RvUoBbS6Jmn_MYmcJCLCBAy_bUYzdWAEpwsywgRJeqI/edit#gid=0">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RvUoBbS6Jmn_MYmcJCLCBAy_bUYzdWAEpwsywgRJeqI/edit#gid=0</a>. Teams must be on that sheet and finalized by 4pm EST on February 6th.</p>
